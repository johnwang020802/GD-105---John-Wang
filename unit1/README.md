Unit 1 includes five projects for class GD105. 

The line project is used to practice drawing the line using stroke functions. The Pvector object is used here to define the original value for X- X-coordinate and Y-coordinate. The original group of lines was only horizontal and vertical; later, all lines were rotated to 30 degrees. 

The shape project includes four circles and one square. Circles and lines built in the shape were placed in first-quarter and third-quarter positions. a square was drawn in the center and rotated in 3D using the Pshape object,

The text project covers how to create a Font file and how to use it. ShowcardGothic-Reg-48.vlw was created and later used to load the font. The text function is used to draw the text with a predefined custom font. 

The replica project takes a piece of work from Kamal Boullatta, Qasita, URL: Kamal Boullata, Qasida, 2018 | Meem Gallery (meemartgallery.com;  The image size is 264*84. The bottom of the output is precisely a replica of the reference image by pixel, and the top of the output is the entire bottom image rotated to 180 degrees. Finally, we can see one completely closed image. 

The personal project presents one of my favorite pillow toys, which I have played with daily for more than four years. This toy's name is; her clothing and hair are always green. Inside the image, all shapes and lines are made of green color; some are very deep, like an outline, and some are a light green color, which mimics the vivid life.
