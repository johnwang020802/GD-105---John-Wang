Unit 1 includes five projects for class GD105. 

The line project is used to practice drawing lines using stroke functions. The Pvector object is used here to define the original value for the X-coordinate and the
Y-coordinate. The original group of lines were only horizontal and vertical; then, all lines were rotated by 30 degrees. 

The shape project includes four circles and one square. Circles and lines built for the shape were placed in first-quarter and third-quarter positions. A square was drawn in the center and rotated in 3D using the Pshape object.

The text project covers how to create a Font file and how to use it. ShowcardGothic-Reg-48.vlw was created and later used to load the font. The text function is used to draw the text with a predefined custom font. 

The replica project takes a piece of work from Kamal Boullatta, Qasita, URL: Kamal Boullata, Qasida, 2018 | Meem Gallery (meemartgallery.com;  The image size is 264*84. The bottom of the output is a precise replica of the referenced image by pixel, and the top of the output is the entire bottom image rotated by 180 degrees. 

The personal project is the mascot character for my favorite streamer; it's called a sapling. Inside the image, all shapes and lines are green; some shades are very deep, like the outline, and some are a light green color.
