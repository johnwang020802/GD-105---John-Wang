Unit 2 covers four projects for class GD105.

The collage projects assembles all my cat pictures by using a function, which can place, scale, and rotate the images. Jasper, Max, and Fork are all my cats; Karl is my sisters cat.
 
The buildup projects continuously draws a spiral-shaped ellipses around the canvas, starting from the center with an X offset. The angle increases by 0.05, and the radius increases by 0.5 for each frame. Once the radius is larger than 200 or less than 50, the radius will decrease instead of increase. The output display, made by movie maker, takes the first 300 frames. 

The XYControl project uses the X and Y coordinates to map the circle's position and size continuously. The value of X and Y is between 0 to 1. Once values of X and Y are larger than 1, the value will be reset to 0. The output display, made by movie maker, takes the first 300 frames. The second version of the project uses audio to control the circle's position and size; as the audio volume changes, the circle's position and size change as well.
 
My personal project tries to mimic a clock pendulum that's inspired by the intro of the game Chrono Trigger. The physical parameters are from https://www.myphysicslab.com/pendulum/pendulum-en.html. The formula is taken from chatGPT because I am not good at physics. The parameters and formula are adjusted in the project.
