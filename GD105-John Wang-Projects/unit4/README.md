Unit 4 covers two projects for class GD105.

The fireworks project uses particle class to simulate real fireworks. Particle class has a position, velocity, acceleration, colors, and lifespan, etc. Gravity is added to the particles' acceleration. The fireworks can be exploited in different shapes, such as hearts, flowers, stars, etc., by random colors. The position and state of the main firework particles can be tracked and updated based on their velocity and the applied forces.

The small tree project uses the Pvector class to build the branch class and tree class to mimic the tree growth. The new branches are periodically added to the trucks. As the tree grows, more and more leaves are added to simulate fuller foliage. The 30 types of tree names, growing rates, mature size, and root depths are collected and put into the tree_data.csv file. After data is loaded into the table,  the 10 rows of tables display on the screen, and the tables are scrollable to be used to review all data. The tree name is from a data set, and the growth rate and max growth stage can be changed from the data set.
