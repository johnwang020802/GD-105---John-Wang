Unit 5 covers one project for class GD105.

The fruit stock project used five types of fruits, like apple, banana, cherry, grape, and orange, to mimic the stock market. The right side displays the fruit price change curve for one year, one month, and one week. The default balance is $100; the player can spend the default balance of $100 to buy fruit at a low price and sell it at a high price. Once the balance reaches the milestone of each $100, like $100, $200, or $300, the congratulatory message and five-point star will display for a short time. The market data.cvs file is used to save the balance, start day for play, and fruit inventory. When a player closes the canvas, the balance, start day for play, and fruit inventory will be saved into the market data.cvs file, and the player can continue the next day. The refresh button is used to refresh the market data; the player can start to pick different fruits. The reset button will reset all data to default, such as the balance will be reset to $100, the start date for play will be reset to current day,  and all inventory will become 0. With all the above functions,  the fruit stock game will allow players to continue playing for more than one day.
